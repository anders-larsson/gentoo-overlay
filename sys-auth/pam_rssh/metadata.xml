		This PAM module provides ssh-agent based authentication. The primary design goal is to avoid typing password when you sudo on remote servers. Instead, you can simply touch your hardware security key (e.g. Yubikey/Canokey) to fulfill user verification. The process is done by forwarding the remote authentication request to client-side ssh-agent as a signature request.

		This project is developed in Rust language to minimize security flaws.
