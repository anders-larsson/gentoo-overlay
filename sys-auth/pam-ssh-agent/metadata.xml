		The goal of this project is to provide a PAM authentication module determining the identity of a user based on a signature request and response sent via the ssh-agent protocol to a potentially remote ssh-agent.
		One scenario that this module can be used in is to grant escalated privileges on a remote system accessed using ssh with agent forwarding enabled and the sudo command.

			Use FIPS-validated cryptography.

			Unless you are someone that has a mandate to only run FIPS validated crypto implementations, you probably don't want this feature enabled.
